# ASCII-Jetpack-Joyride

## Description and Features-

You are the angel mandalorian!
You must beat the evil Darth Vader to save Baby Yoda!

### Obstacles

Navigate your player through the map and shoot your way through the fire beams, escape the grasp of magnets, and collect coins to increase your score.

### Boss Enemy

When your score reaches 50, the evil boss takes notice of you and comes to fight you. The boss has 16 health points and can shoot seeking snowballs. You can shoot down the snowballs too.

### Lives and bullets

However, you have only three lives and a limited number of seconds to finish the game, else you lose. You can only shoot 5 bullets at a time, so use your bullets smartly.

### Power Up's

Seems too hard? Don't worry! You have a speed boost in case you are running out of time and a shield which saves you from damage for one hit for 10 seconds (takes 60 seconds to recharge).

### Friendly Drogon

We also have a dragon on our side! It has infinte bullets unlike our Mandalorian but has only one life. So, use it wisely!
